## Description

I'd like to be able to download voice packs with the following voice(s) from Azure AI Speech Studio ([list of available voices][voices] and [voice gallery][gallery]):

<!-- Please list voices from the Azure Speech Services that you'd like to use. Example: `fr_BE`, Japanese, Spanish (Colombia) and add them to the issue title as well. -->

- `cs-CZ-VlastaNeural` <!-- for example -->

## Help make EdgeTX better!

<!-- You'll be able to check these boxes once the issue is created. -->

- [ ] (optional) I can help reviewing the new voice packs once they're generated.

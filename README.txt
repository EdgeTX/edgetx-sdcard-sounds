This folder (/SOUNDS/) contains /en/ which in turn contains two folders.

SOUNDS/en/ contains “Lexi” with a new set of sounds and different organization than in previous sound packages. Sound tracks in this folder can be selected for use in SPECIAL FUNCTIONS.

SOUNDS/en/system contains “Lexi” with the standard set of sounds with two additional.

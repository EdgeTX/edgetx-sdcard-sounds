# Contributing

There are several ways to contribute to the evolution of the EdgeTX audio package (this repository). I'll list some, from the simplest to the most complicated:

## Giving your opinion

We are now starting the new audio package, using neural network technology to generate more realistic voices, removing the familiar robotic sound from voices. Our goal is to have clearer, cleaner audio and to be reproduced with quality on all transmitters. With this, your opinion is very important to know if you are enjoying the result and if you have encountered any problems.

If you have encountered any issues or want to contribute your opinion, please [open a new issue][new-issue].

## Reporting translation errors

We are offering audio packages for different languages, and relying on automated translations for some of them. If you hear something that seems incorrect in your language, please [open a new issue][new-issue].

## Reporting pronunciation errors

The technologies that are used to generate voices don't always read the text the way an EdgeTX user would. That is especially true for words that are very specific to remote-controlled crafts. If you notice imperfections in how a given text is read, please [open a new issue][new-issue]. That may allow us to adjust the text and get a better output.

## Expressing interest for new languages or locales

The languages (e.g. English) and locales (e.g. `GB`, `US`) that are currently available have been requested over time. If you'd like to use an audio package in a different language or a specific locale, please let us know by [opening a new issue][new-issue].

## Fixing errors and contributing code

If you want to fix existing errors or contribute ideas or code, you are welcome to say so in any open issue, or to open a pull request!

If you need guidance to navigate this repository or opening a pull request, please say so, we'll be happy to help you get started.

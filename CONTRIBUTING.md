# Contributing

There are several ways to contribute to the evolution of the EdgeTX audio package (this repository). I'll list some, from the simplest to the most complicated:

## Giving your opinion

We are now starting the new audio package, using neural network technology to generate more realistic voices, removing the familiar robotic sound from voices. Our goal is to have clearer, cleaner audio and to be reproduced with quality on all transmitters. With this, your opinion is very important to know if you are enjoying the result and if you have encountered any problems.

If you have encountered any issues or want to contribute your opinion, please [open a new Issue](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx-sdcard-sounds/issues).

## Directory structure

### SOUNDS

This folder has the audio files already processed and separated by language.

To use them, the language folder (for example, `en`) must be under the `SOUNDS` folder of your `SDCARD`. With the folder added, go to the EdgeTX settings menu and select the language of the audio language that will be used (eg English).

To use any audio on your switches, first copy the file you want to use to your language folder, then you can use this file in your `Global functions` by selecting a switch for the function and choosing the `Play track` option.
